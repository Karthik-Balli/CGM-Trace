        <tr>
            <td>Standard Deviation (SD)</td>
            <td>A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of numbers, calculated as the square root of the variance.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Standard Deviation of Blood Glucose Rate of Change (SDR)</td>
            <td>The standard deviation of the rate of change of blood glucose values over a specific time period. It provides an indication of the variability in blood glucose fluctuations.</td>

            <td>The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) in a sorted set of numbers, representing the middle 50% of the data. It is a measure of the spread of the data that is less sensitive to outliers than the range.</td>

            <td>Glycemic Variability (GV)</td>
            <td>A measure of the degree of fluctuation in blood glucose levels over a specific time period. It can be assessed using various metrics such as standard deviation, coefficient of variation, or mean absolute glucose change.</td>

            <td>These metrics are used to evaluate the percentage of time spent within different blood glucose ranges. TAR refers to the percentage of time spent within a specific target range, TIR indicates the percentage of time spent above the lower limit of the target range, and TBR represents the percentage of time spent below the target range.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Analysis (CONGA)</td>
            <td>A method to assess glucose variability by analyzing the differences between glucose values at different time intervals, such as CONGA-1 (1-hour interval), CONGA-2 (2-hour interval), etc.</td>

            <td>Mean Absolute Glucose Excursions (MAGE)</td>
